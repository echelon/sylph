RATING SYSTEM IS TODO.

Ratings will be resources too? 
	Yes, initially we need to do that!
	If it's too resource cumbersome, we can scale back. 
That's going to be one freaking huge resource database. 


Ratings System
==============
	* Thumbs up / down? - Probably
	* One-to-five? 
	* Option to star?
		* If so, will it be limited?

Exchange System
===============
	* How do we aggregate ratings?
		* Get from each user?
		* Get from an aggregator?
	* How do we combat bad ratings?
