If a library is not installed on the system, or another version is preferred, we keep them here. This directory is placed in the python path.

_For practical considerations, we will not distribute all software packages with sylph._ Only a few scripts will be included, and the rest must be installed (if they are not already included in your Python version).

Required Libraries
------------------
* [**Django**](http://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework, version 1.1.x to 1.2.x 
* [**Celery**](http://celeryproject.org/) messaging framework [[src](http://github.com/ask/celery)], as well as the following support libraries:
	* [django-celery](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-celery) adapter for django [[src](http://github.com/ask/django-celery/)]
	* [**carrot**](http://github.com/ask/carrot/)
	* [**anyjson**](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/anyjson)
* [**BeautifulSoup**](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), but make sure it's ***version 3.0.8.1***
* [**RDFLib 2.4 series**](http://www.rdflib.net/2.4.0/) (will update to 3.0 soon)

Choose Between...
-----------------

_Running Celery on RabbitMQ or a plain SQL backend:_

* [**amqplib**](http://code.google.com/p/py-amqplib/) for RabbitMQ/AMQP
* [**ghettoq**](http://github.com/ask/ghettoq) if you want to run celery on a plain SQL backend

For older versions of Python
----------------------------

* [**importlib**](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/importlib) as it's only included versions 3.1+ (Python 2.7 includes importlib's import\_module, which may be enough.)
